Blockchain implementation in Python 3

#Blockchain implementation in Python 3
This code explains the blockchain and its implementation using python programming language.

I created an api using flask to communication with the blockchain network.
I created my own coin called #Jaycoin which contains  index, timestamp, proof, prvious_hash and the transaction in each block.

#its simple to understand and implement.

#Buzz me if you are having challenges implementing them
